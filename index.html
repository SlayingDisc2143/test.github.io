  <h2>Information Technology</h2>

  <p>I am inserting myself into the computer maintinance via coursework and independent studies.
     I have had goals of moving to a bigger city to work on server racks at will. During my classes on the subject of computer maintinance I will be documenting heavily what I have learned. 
     Using this information, I will see what sectors of technology interest me so I can persue what I don't fully understand. Networking seems like it is for me, However I prefer the basic,
     "Is it plugged in and turning on" type job to start out with until I really know what I am doing.

     It all is dependant on what I have learned previously taking computer coursework, and what I am about to digest.
     I would like to learn how to host a DNS server for a personal HTML Blog or somthing equivilant.
     More important to me I wish to walk away with some certyification as a result of the coursework in this class.
     I also enjoy working on my hobbies as well, including:
